## Bank Marketing Decision Tree | Internship Task 03

This project involves building a **Decision Tree Classifier** on the **Bank Marketing dataset** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and campaign details. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization steps.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objective

Build and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** to:

* Predict client subscription to a term deposit
* Preprocess categorical data for machine learning
* Evaluate model accuracy and interpret results through visualizations

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

* **Name:** bank.csv
* **Source:** [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
* **Includes features such as:**

  * Age, Job, Marital Status, Education
  * Credit Default, Housing Loan, Personal Loan
  * Contact Type, Month, Day, Duration
  * Previous Campaign Outcome
  * Target (y = 1 for subscription, 0 for no subscription)

---

## ðŸ“Š What I Did

* Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
* Checked data structure and handled categorical values using LabelEncoder
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets
* Built and trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** using scikit-learn
* Evaluated the model using a **confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report**
* Visualized the decision tree diagram for interpretability

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries Used:**

* `pandas` â€“ data handling
* `numpy` â€“ numerical operations
* `scikit-learn` â€“ machine learning models and metrics
* `matplotlib` â€“ visualizations
* `seaborn` â€“ statistical plots

---

## ðŸ“Œ Outcome

* Built a working **Decision Tree Classifier** on the Bank Marketing dataset
* Visualized a clean, organized decision tree by limiting tree depth
* Gained hands-on experience in:

  * Data preprocessing and encoding
  * Supervised classification model building
  * Model evaluation using multiple metrics
  * Visualizing decision tree structures
